## What to Expect üßê

In this benchmark, we gauge the performance based on the following metrics:

- **Search Speed**: Vector search throughput and latency at varying precision levels.
- **Data Handling**: Upload pace and index building speed.
- **Cost Analysis**: Value for your buck.

## Our Promise of Transparency ü§ù

We are providing access to the entire source code for these benchmark tests, allowing anyone to validate our findings or even carry out the tests on different hardware. Explore the benchmark framework on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/myscale/vector-db-benchmark), and get the source code for this website on [this repository](https://github.com/myscale/benchmark). Be a part of this benchmark - review the code, run the tests, and let the community know!

## The Datasets üìä

We have employed the following datasets for an insightful analysis:

| Dataset Name | Description | Number of Vectors | Number of Queries | Dimension | Distance | Filters | Payload Columns | Download Link |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| laion-768-5m-ip | Derived from [LAION 2B images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2b-multi-vit-h-14-embeddings/tree/main). | 5,000,000 | 10,000 | 768 | IP | N/A | 0 | [Link](https://myscale-datasets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/laion-5m-test-ip.hdf5) |
| laion-768-5m-probability | Derived from [LAION 2B images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2b-multi-vit-h-14-embeddings/tree/main). | 5,000,000 | 10,000 | 768 | IP | Ratio 0.01 | `[probability (Float64)]` | [Vectors](https://myscale-datasets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/laion-768-5m-ip-probability.hdf5) [Queries](https://myscale-datasets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/laion-768-5m-ip-probability-0.01.hdf5) |
| laion-768-5m-probability | Derived from [LAION 2B images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2b-multi-vit-h-14-embeddings/tree/main). | 5,000,000 | 10,000 | 768 | IP | Ratio 0.1 | `[probability (Float64)]` | [Vectors](https://myscale-datasets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/laion-768-5m-ip-probability.hdf5) [Queries](https://myscale-datasets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/laion-768-5m-ip-probability-0.1.hdf5) |

**Note**: The `probability` column stores random floats from a uniform distribution `[0, 1]`. Ratio 0.01 implies that the query encompasses `dataset_size * 0.01` range.

## Contenders and Setup ü•ä

Let‚Äôs peek into the specs and costs of the cloud services we‚Äôve put to the test.

| [MyScale](https://myscale.com/) | Standard Pod of Size x1 | 120 |  |
| [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) | s1.x1 | 80 | Optimized for storage. |
| [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) | 5 x p2.x1 | 600 | Performance-optimized via horizontal scaling. |
| [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) | 4C 32G | 273 | Utilizes HNSW algorithm. |

| [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com) | Performance-optimized 4 CU | 458 | Price reduced from $746 to $458 as of June 14, 2023. |
| [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com) | Cost-optimized 1 CU | 77 | Added on Sep 6, 2023. |
| Postgres with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) | [db.r6g.xlarge](https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/rds/db.r6g.xlarge?region=us-east-1&os=PostgreSQL&cost_duration=monthly&reserved_term=Standard.partialUpfront) (4C 32GB) | 329 | Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL |
| Postgres [pgvecto.rs](https://github.com/tensorchord/pgvecto.rs) | [db.r6g.xlarge](https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/rds/db.r6g.xlarge?region=us-east-1&os=PostgreSQL&cost_duration=monthly&reserved_term=Standard.partialUpfront) (4C 32GB) | 329 | Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL |
| [AWS OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) | [r6g.2xlarge.search](https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/opensearch/r6g.2xlarge.search?region=us-east-1&cost_duration=monthly&reserved_term=Standard.noUpfront) (8C 64GB) | 488 | Amazon OpenSearch Service domain |
| [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/home) |  aws.es.datahot.r6gd (3.9vCPU 30GB) | 982.80 | Elastic Cloud (Enterprise subscription) |

To ensure a fair play, we operate the client (`c4.xlarge`) in the same region as the cloud service to keep networking interference to a minimum.
